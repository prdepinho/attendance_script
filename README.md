A script I made to calculate my attendance balance for when I worked at a
company that didn't have the tools to easily view it. Anyway, at least this is
an excuse to pratice Ruby scripting. I typed the data from the papers that the
attendance machine generates each time I put my finger in it (I have no idea
how they are called either in English or Portuguese) into a txt file which is 
input into the script that generates the balance taking into account holidays and
weekends.
